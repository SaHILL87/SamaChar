      "content": "CNN  Twin bomb threats hit Indian airliners on opposite sides of the globe on Tuesday, forcing an emergency landing in the Arctic and fighter jets to scramble in Asia  the latest in a series of similar hoax scares for the countrys airlines. Indian airlines have faced a number of threats in recent days, all of which have been found to be hoaxes, flag carrier Air India said in a statement Tuesday, as authorities in New Delhi and around the world investigate the string of false bomb warnings. On Tuesday, an Air India flight from New Delhi to Chicago made an emergency landing in Iqaluit, Canadas northernmost city. All 211 passengers and crew were relocated to the airport, Canadian police said. Air India flight 127 was the subject of a security threat posted online and diverted as a precautionary measure, the airline said. On Wednesday, Air India said a Canadian Air Force aircraft was transferring the passengers to Chicago. In a separate incident Tuesday, Singapore scrambled two Air Force F-15 fighter jets to escort an Air India Express passenger plane away from populated areas before landing at the city states Changi Airport, the Singaporean defense minister said on social platform X. Flight AXB684 was enroute to Singapore from the southern Indian city of Madurai when the airline received an email that there was a bomb onboard, minister Ng Eng Hen said. The threat prompted Singapore to activate its ground-based air defense systems and explosive ordnance disposal, and the plane was handed to airport police upon arrival, Ng said, adding that investigations are ongoing. Multiple flights by Indian carriers have been delayed or diverted due to false bomb threats since Monday. They include domestic flights on low-cost airlines as well as international flights. The threats have appeared to come from emails or social media posts. The affected trips include an Air India flight from Mumbai to New York that was diverted to Delhi on Monday because of a hoax bomb alert, a spokesperson for the carrier told CNN. And two flights operated by IndiGo from Mumbai to Oman and Saudi Arabia faced long delays due to bomb threats, the budget airline said. Low-cost carrier SpiceJet also said it received a bomb threat to a flight to Mumbai from the northern city of Darbhanga on Tuesday. The aircraft landed safely at Mumbai Airport and was directed to an isolation bay as a precautionary measure, SpiceJet said in a statement, adding that after security checks the flight was cleared for further operations. Though it remains unclear whether the threats are connected, or what the motive may be, Air India said they could not be dismissed. As a responsible airline operator all threats are taken seriously, the airline said, adding it was working with authorities to ensure the perpetrators are held accountable for the disruption and inconvenience caused to passengers. Indias Ministry of Civil Aviation MOCA is reportedly meeting Wednesday to discuss the situation, according to CNN affiliate News 18. CNN has reached out to MOCA, Indias Bureau of Civil Aviation Security and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation for comment. The Air India emergency landing in Canada comes as tensions rise between the two countries after Canada expelled six Indian diplomats, including the high commissioner, on Monday. Canada has accused agents of the Indian government of being linked to homicides, harassment and other acts of violence against Sikh separatists in the country. India called the accusations preposterous and in turn expelled six Canadian diplomats. While there is no indication that the bomb hoaxes are linked to the diplomatic spat, threats to Air India flights in Canada have revived painful memories of the 1985 bombing of Air India flight 182 by Sikh extremists, the worst terrorist attack in Canadas history. The flight from Montreal to New Delhi exploded off the coast of Ireland, killing all 329 people on board, including more than 250 Canadians. This story has been updated with additional information.",

      "content": "Reuters  Shares of Hyundai Motor India dropped as much as 6 in their market debut on Tuesday, after a tepid response from retail investors to the pricing of the countrys largest ever initial public offering. The stock listed at 1,934 rupees 23 on Indias National Stock Exchange, below its offer price of 1,960 rupees 23.31, and traded down 4 at 1,882.10 rupees 22.39 by 0548 GMT 148 a.m. ET, giving the company a valuation of 1.53 trillion rupees 18.2 billion. Hyundai, Indias No. 2 carmaker with a market share of 15, was targeting a valuation of 19 billion through the IPO. Its record 3.3 billion IPO was oversubscribed more than two-fold last week, led largely by institutional investors, but pricing concerns deterred retail investors who worried they would not be able to make gains on the listing. Shares of Indian rivals have also slipped in recent weeks as car sales slow after two years of record highs, with customers delaying purchases on worries about stubborn inflation. Hyundais issue has been stiffly priced and that seems to be weighing down on its listing as well, said Arun Kejriwal, founder of Kejriwal Research. Besides, the volumes seen so far are driven only by institutional investors, and is rather poor for an IPO of Hyundais size. Tuesdays listing in Mumbai is Hyundai Motors first debut outside its home market of South Korea and comes at a time when Indias equity markets have risen sharply. RELATED ARTICLE Hyundai Indias biggest IPO could come from South Korean car manufacturer With competition from domestic rivals Tata Motors and Mahindra  Mahindra, Hyundai Motor plans to use proceeds from its sale of a stake of 17.5 in the Indian unit to invest in research and launch new products. Hyundai Motor will play a crucial role in Hyundai Motor Indias long-term growth through our collaboration in RD, design, manufacturing, the Korean automakers CEO, Jaehoon Chang, said at a listing ceremony in Mumbai. Seven of Indias 10 largest IPOs, including Hyundai India, reported listing day losses ranging from 5 to 27, according to data from Dealogic. While Hyundais market valuation is much smaller than Indian market leader Maruti Suzukis 45 billion, analysts have expressed concerns over the narrower gap in their price-to-earnings PE ratios. The issue had valued Hyundai at 26 times its fiscal 2024 earnings, not far off the multiple of 29 for Maruti. Some major brokerages, however, see long-term value in the stock. Nomura started coverage of Hyundai with a buy rating and price target of 2,472 rupees 29.40. The brokerage said it liked Hyundais high concentration of SUVs in the portfolio, which accounted for 67 of sales in the April-to-June 2024 quarter. Similarly, Macquarie analysts began coverage with an outperform rating and price target of 2,235 rupees 26.58, saying Hyundais SUV-centric portfolio commanded a PE premium. We shall leverage our deep understanding of consumer preferences to successfully expand our passenger vehicle portfolio, Hyundai Indias chief operating officer Tarun Garg said at the listing ceremony. Shares of Maruti and Tata Motors were down 1, in line with the Nifty Auto index This story has been updated with additional information.",

      "title": "In a single Delhi house, several hundred years of Indian history By Aishwarya S Iyer 6 minute read Updated 715 AM EDT, Mon September 30, 2024",
      "content": "Chandni Chowk was once the kind of neighborhood that people spoke about with awe. Built in the 17th century by Emperor Shah Jahan, it reflected the wealth of the once mighty Mughal empire, quickly becoming one of Indias most desirable districts, where the rich and powerful resided in fashionable mansions. Today, this corner of the historic walled city Old Delhi has a different vibe, attracting visitors to a lively street food scene. Architectural reminders of its former glory are still visible, but the swanky homes of the wealthy are no more, many converted to hotels or other businesses, their occupants long gone. Not Ajay Pershad, though. Aged 80 but still going strong, Pershad sits in the courtyard of his grand 120-room ancestral mansion, almost the last man standing of Chandni Chowks old guard, holding on to the splendor of a bygone age. It is the only living mansion on the historic street of Chandni Chowk, says Pershad, a descendant of Chunna Mal, a moneylender and businessman who built the home way back, according to an inscribed golden slab inside the buildings hallway, in 1864. Some 160 years later, although Pershad is clinging to his forebears legacy, much of the glamor of preceding centuries has vanished. Most of the mansions rooms are shuttered and unused. The antiques inside them are gathering dust. Ajay Pershad sits in the courtyard of his grand 120-room ancestral haveli traditional house. Aishwarya S. IyerCNN And out of Chunna Mals 32 heirs, only Pershad and his family of 10 remain. And, he says, hes alone in wanting to keep the place. The family is planning to sell, but I am against it, he says. I have been trying to bring them on the same table. Pershad says hes hoping to ensure one of the only privately owned mansions in the area is not converted into a hotel. Back in the days of Mughal empire, which was founded in the 16th century and grew to control much of the Indian subcontinent before dwindling and being dissolved in 1857, Indias cultural and architectural heritage gained numerous iconic structures. In Delhi, these include the Humayuns Tomb, Jama Masjid mosque and the Old Fort. The neighboring city of Agra got the Taj Mahal. Designated one of the seven wonders of the world, it draws in thousands of visitors each day. And then there was Chandni Chowk, built as a part of Emperor Shah Jahans new capital Shahjahanabad - or Old Delhi as it later became. Many parts of this street were destroyed when the people revolted against British occupation in 1857. The British crushed the rebellion, thereby ending Mughal rule in Delhi and marking the beginning of the British Raj. However, mansions like the one belonging to Chunna Mals family were untouched. Chunna Mal was pro-British. We enjoyed a lot of privileges because of it, Pershad explains. His ancestor, he says, was appointed the first municipal commissioner of Old Delhi. Today, Pershads home is symbolic of both the glory of the 17th century and how it is changing or being forgotten today. People come from miles away to pray at the Shri Digambar Jain Lal Temple red and the Hindu Gauri Shankar Temple orange at Chandni Chowk. Aishwarya S. IyerCNN The moonlit crossing The gloomy spaciousness inside the sprawling mansion also stands in stark contrast to the modern day Chandni Chowk Road outside. The districts oldest street, right in the heart of Delhi begins at the entrance of the Mughal-era Red Fort, where the annual Independence Day flag hoisting is overseen by Indias prime minister, and stretches 1,400 yards to the 17th century Fatehpuri mosque. Bustling with businessmen, cycle rickshaws, and shoppers whove come in to buy clothes and jewelry or eat the mouth-watering food, it draws In thousands of tourists and visitors each day For Rameen Khan, the founder of the company City Tales which organizes heritage walks and tours in and outside Delhi, this roads importance extends beyond its material offerings. In its nooks and corners this street has preserved over three and a half centuries of Indias history. It hides in plain sight, unnoticed and unappreciated, but a testament to the unfolding of Indias past, he says. According to Khan, an octagonal pool that would sparkle with reflections of the moon, once stood here. Hence the name Chandni Chowk, meaning Moonlit Crossing. Since it was the grandest part of the stretch, it is fitting that the entire stretch is named after it, Khan adds. RELATED ARTICLE How India got stuck in its own unusual time zone Knotting history and faith It isnt only multiple eras of history that intertwine here in this sliver of Old Delhi. Several houses of worship co-exist in Chandni Chowk a Jain temple, a Hindu temple, a mosque, a Sikh shrine, and a Baptist church. This shows the ability of India to be able to peacefully cohabit as a secular country, despite its many challenges, Khan says. Sheetal Saxena, 23, a housewife and local resident, says there continues to be good bonhomie between different communities here. The fact that this place accommodates anyone is what makes it truly emblematic of India, she says. These religious centers are also tourist attractions, notably the reddish-pink Digambar Jain Lal Temple. It is revered by those who follow the Indian religion Jainism, which emphasizes non-violence and a strict diet that eschews garlic and onions. Originally built in the 1600s, the temple was renovated with red sandstone in 1878, giving it the nickname the Red Temple. At a time when the Mughal empire was losing its grip on the country, a nobleman in its army built a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Shiva in the 1760s. Other groups were becoming stronger now. You can see that in the construction of a temple so close to the Mughal throne, Khan says. On the other side of the road is the Central Baptist Church, which dates to the British colonial era. According to Khan, the original Christian church was destroyed in the revolt of 1857, then later rebuilt. But travelers who know where to look can head inside, where theyll find inscriptions of prayers and commandments inscribed in Urdu on golden-colored slabs. Rickshaw pullers rest along a street in Chandni Chowk, Old Delhi, India on August 6, 2023. Pradeep DambarageNurphotoGetty Images Another symbol of the declining Mughal empire lies in the Golden Mosque, where Persian emperor Nader Shah ordered the plunder of Delhi in 1793. Next to it, a Sikh shrine memorializes where one of the 10 gurus who founded the faith was murdered. It was a police station during the Mughal era. After the Mughals lost their power, the Sikhs built their temple  called a gurudwara  in the spot. For Khan these buildings are a reflection of the different eras that the neighborhood has witnessed. Finding a way forward Locals say Chandni Chowks popularity increased recently when Delhis local government unveiled a new look, banning all traffic apart from rickshaws. New red sandstone walkways were laid down to create a pedestrian zone and more trees planted. Some say theres still much work to be done. Dilip Saxena, a local retiree who has spent his whole life living nearby, says that beyond the main thoroughfare, the neighborhood is blighted by dirt, monsoon floods and building fires. He says its status as a residential area is being eroded. When I was growing up here there were 13 homes in the area around my home. Now there are only two. People have sold off their property as commercial establishments and moved out, he said. One of those commercial establishments is a new mall 100 yards off Chandni Chowk. With the mall coming there is a concern that the old-world charm of this area may be forgotten or altered over time. As generations keep coming, lesser and lesser people will know about this history and that is a concern, says Saxena. Will they stop at this mall, or build many more? Who knows? he asks. For Ajay Pershad too, this development is for the visitors, not for those who live here. You can ban vehicles, but what do we residents do during medical emergencies? Despite that, Pershad is certain he will not depart. This is the rich history of my family right here. I cannot even think of leaving.",

      "content": "Our live coverage for the day has ended. Follow the latest India election news or read through the updates below. The votes were counted Tuesday after the worlds largest election was held in India. From April 19 to June 1, more than 640 million people cast their vote at polling stations from the high peaks of the Himalayas to the remote jungles of the west. Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared victory on Tuesday  but his goal of winning an unassailable majority lay in tatters with early results showing voters reduced the extent of his partys grip on power. In less than a decade, Asias richest man Mukesh Ambani has upended Indias telecom sector and become a top player in sectors ranging from media to retail as chairman of Indias most valuable private company Reliance Industries. His ambition and breathless pace of expansion is matched by Gautam Adani, founder of the Adani group, who helms businesses ranging from ports and power to defense and aerospace. Reliance Industries and the Adani Group are sprawling conglomerates worth over 200 billion each, with businesses in sectors ranging from fossil fuels and clean energy to media and technology. Investors have been cheering the duos ability to adroitly bet on sectors prioritized for development by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. As a result, these three men  Modi, Ambani and Adani  are playing a fundamental role in shaping the economic superpower India will become in the coming decades. The South Asian country is poised to become a 21st-century economic powerhouse, offering a real alternative to China for investors hunting for growth and manufacturers looking to reduce risks in their supply chains. Worth 3.7 trillion in 2023, India is the worlds fifth largest economy, jumping four spots in the rankings during Modis decade in office and leapfrogging the United Kingdom. Sustained expansion will push India higher up the ranks of the worlds biggest economies, with some observers forecasting the South Asian nation to become number three behind only the US and China by 2027. Despite these successes, soaring youth unemployment and inequality remain stubbornly persistent problems. In 2022, the country ranked a lowly 147 on gross domestic product GDP per person, a measure of living standards, according to the World Bank. To spur growth, the Modi government has begun a massive infrastructure transformation and heavily promoting digital connectivity  with Adani and Ambani becoming key allies. Both tycoons are considered vocal champions of Modi, and prominent politicians from opposition parties in India have often questioned Modis ties with Indias super-rich. Read the full analysis. CNNs Jessie Yeung contributed to this report from Mumbai. India is one of the largest media markets in the world, according to Reporters Without Borders RSF, with more than 20,000 daily newspapers across the country and about 450 privately owned channels dedicated to news, which broadcast in dozens of languages. Yet despite its size and diversity, critics say the media industry is growing increasingly subservient to Modis government. India fell 25 places on the Press Freedom Index between 2015 and 2023, to 161st place  below neighboring Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. In the latest index for this year it rose slightly to 159th place but remains below all neighbors except Bangladesh 165th. There has been a sharp deterioration in the status of media over the last 10 years, Committee to Protect Journalists CPJ India representative Kunal Majumder told CNN, adding that this included imprisonment and invoking terror laws to criminalize journalists. There has also been an uptick, it said, in the use of anti-terror laws  which allow for detention without trial or charge for up to 180 days  against reporters. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not taken a single solo press conference in his decade-long rule. The government of the popular but divisive leader stands accused by opponents of suppressing media pluralism. Modi critics fear further erosion of the protections afforded to Indias free press if he is elected. More than 40 of Indias 1.4 billion people are under 25 a tech-savvy and mostly English-speaking labor force. Like millions of migrants, many of them are drawn to the countrys financial capital Mumbai, full of aspiration and ambition. And its stories like these that inspire them. The tech developer Growing up in the slums of Mumbai, Javed Khatri never used a smartphone or computer. But unlike many children in the slums, he completed 10th grade  the first person in four generations of his family to do so  then studied computer science at an engineering college. He is now building an online platform to connect tech firms with engineers. He moved his family out of the slum, and supports his parents. Both his siblings went to college and pursued their own careers. None of this would have been possible a generation ago, he says. The influencer Apoorva Mukhija hadnt planned to be a content creator, so after graduation she took a job with a tech firm in Bangalore, the southern city known as Indias Silicon Valley. Then one day I just woke up, realized  my job just didnt pay as well as content did, and I hated living in that city, Mukhija, 22, tells CNN from a pastel-pink couch at her new apartment in Mumbai, which she says is her dream city. Her career has thrived, winning her recognition from local media and amassing 1.3 million Instagram followers. The internet holds a wealth of opportunities for young Indians. The countrys influencer marketing industry is expected to be worth more than 281 million in 2024, according to consultancy EY India. Smartphones and social media are fueling this growth. The shoemaker At age 13, Jameel Shah ran away from his village in Bihar, Indias poorest state, where his father wasnt earning enough from farming to send the kids to school. In Mumbai, he saw an opportunity in the expensive imported dance shoes required for dance classes. He took two samples back to the narrow alleys of Dharavi, a hub for leather and textile manufacturers. With their expertise, and his own experience working in bag and wallet factories, Shah began experimenting. The business grew, attracting stylists and choreographers who redistributed the shoes to dance studios. And they even made it onto the big screen. Almost two decades later, Shah Shoes has helped support his family. Hes bought a house for his parents and started an education center in his home village teaching literacy to those who cant afford school. A key tool was the rise of social media, particularly Facebook, helping him find customers  which Shah credited to Prime Minister Modis push for a digital India. Read the full story. Indias armed forces, the worlds second-largest in terms of personnel, have made big improvements in their abilities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi  but face challenges no matter who wins the election, an analyst said. Viraj Solanki, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the armed forces have centralized control under Modi while making improvements to joint operations based on the theater where forces are deployed, rather than what each service would like to do. Those include setting up integrated battle groups along the countrys borders with China and Pakistan, Solanki said. China, whose Peoples Liberation Army is the worlds biggest military force, represents Indias biggest worry going forward, he said. Indias military clout remains clearly below Chinas and can be expected to remain so, especially since Beijings defense budget is three times as large as New Delhis, Solanki added. The Modi government has stepped up defense ties with the United States, Japan and Australia  members of the Quad partnership along with India  as a way to offset Chinas advantages. But Solanki said improvements to the Indian military are hamstrung by two key factors. More than half of its defense budget is spent on personnel and pensions, and much of its hardware is of Russian or Soviet origin, meaning spare parts and upgrades may be in short supply as Moscows war in Ukraine soaks up those resources. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was once shunned by the United States. Denied a visa for severe violations of religious freedom, he was effectively banned from entering the country for nearly a decade. But in the years since that ban was lifted, Modi has been progressively embraced by the White House. While the US has positioned itself as a democratic protector in an increasingly populist and polarized era, it has seemingly turned a blind eye to New Delhis alleged human rights abuses at home  where the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has come under scrutiny from rights groups and opposition lawmakers for its increasingly strident brand of Hindu nationalist politics and an ongoing crackdown on dissent. Modi and India, the worlds largest democracy, are necessarily a lynchpin in Bidens strategy in Asia. As the worlds most populous country, no major global challenge, from climate change to advances in technology, can be addressed without Indias buy-in, in Bidens view. Both New Delhi and Washington are becoming increasingly uneasy about Beijings growing military might, aggressive territorial claims on land and at sea, and growing economic influence over its smaller neighbors. In an era of growing tensions between the US and China, there are few partners that Biden is more eager to cultivate. Indias first general elections began in October 1951, four years after it gained independence from British rule, and soon after it became a republic in 1950. The election lasted about four months and the Indian National Congress emerged victorious in February 1952. Population boom India then had a population of about 361 million people with 173 million registered electors. Since then, the population has increased nearly four-fold to 1.429 billion, with more than five times the number of eligible voters, according to the Election Commission of India. From paper to voting machines In the first elections, Indians used paper ballots to cast their votes. Electronic voting machines were first used in the state of Kerala in 1982. But because there was no law prescribing their use, the Supreme Court struck down that election. In 1989 laws were amended to allow the use of voting machines after consensus was reached. In recent years, the validity of voting machines has again been questioned  this time by opposition parties that say they are being misused to favor the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party BJP  an allegation the BJP denies. At 7 a.m., Rupali Rao Kilare starts getting ready for the day in the cramped home she shares with five family members. Though the sun has long risen, some alleys remain pitch dark as she weaves through the slum where she lives in Mumbais Goregaon West neighborhood, its narrow walls wedged between tightly packed buildings that block the light. Kilare, 22, must hurry to beat the crowds at the slums communal toilets, before taking a three-wheeled auto-rickshaw to her boss home for her cleaning shift. Just 3 miles about 5 kilometers away in Goregaon East, Shreya Verma, 26, stirs awake in her air-conditioned bedroom, pulls back the curtains and takes in the view of greenery and high-rise buildings. Throwing on a blazer and heels, she hops in an Uber to her marble-floored office at an international tech firm. Though the two women are separated by only a few years in age and a 20-minute drive, their starkly different lives illustrate Indias deepening wealth divide  and the inequality that has empowered some to reach new heights alongside the countrys fast-growing economy, while others are left behind. That inequality has come under particular scrutiny during Indias election. Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been credited with advancing Indias 3.7 trillion economy and bringing the country closer to becoming a global superpower, India remains a largely impoverished nation and its wealth gap is more unequal than it was during British rule. Read the full story. Indias ruling Bharatiya Janata Party BJP has lost one of its most strategic strongholds, the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, dealing a massive blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his allies. The opposition INDIA alliance won 43 out of 80 seats, results from the election commission show  a huge shock for a state that is known as a bastion for the BJP. The bellwether state, also the countrys most populous, is home to about 200 million people, and is currently governed by a firebrand monk-turned-politician, Yogi Adityanath, whose controversial Hindu-first policies have polarized its people along religious lines. Modi contested from the state, winning his seat in the constituency of Varanasi for the third time. Also known as Indias spiritual capital, its a city where tens of thousands of devotees come to pray and gain enlightenment. But that the BJP has lost majority seats in the states will come as a big surprise for Modi and his right-wing party. Located in the heart of the nations Hindi belt  the predominantly Hindi-speaking Indian states where support for Modi and the devotion of his followers is especially strong  it is a state that is often referred to as a litmus test for voter sentiment in India. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi enjoys bipartisan support among the majority of Indian Americans, according to Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The diaspora has long pushed for stronger ties between Washington and New Delhi and yearned to see India as a key global player, Vaishnav said. They see their hopes for India bearing fruit under Modi, he said. As international firms look to diversify operations away from China, and the risk of tensions between Beijing and Washington, Modi is going around the world, talking about how India is open for business again, Vaishnav said. While there are many policies that business and trade stakeholders are unhappy with, Vaishnav said, the feeling is that the needle is pointed in the right direction. Business looks at the opposition and they feel it would be much worse for the bottom line. Despite this majority view, there is a significant minority  comprising non-Hindus and younger generations of Indian Americans born in the US  that is concerned about the decline in democracy and secularism in India, Vaishnav noted. But two issues matter most to the Indian diaspora economics, where they feel corruption is down and growth rates are good, and hard power foreign policy. We are in a dangerous, complicated world with an emerging conflict between US and China, and they want India to be more aligned with US, and more visible in all of our global fora G20, UNSC, etc., Vaishnav said. Read more about Modi and his opposition. Indias election authority confirmed a victory for the coalition headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Modi gave a victory speech earlier at his Bharatiya Janata Party BJP headquarters. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance secured the majority needed with 272 seats. The final votes are still being tallied as the mammoth vote-counting operation draws to a close. India is poised to become a 21st-century economic powerhouse, offering an alternative to China for investors and consumer brands hunting for growth and manufacturers looking to reduce supply chain risks. Ties between China and the West are increasingly frayed, but India enjoys healthy relations with most major economies. So, is the hype around Indias economy, which remains a largely impoverished country, justified? Still very poor Indias economy was worth 3.7 trillion in 2023, making it the worlds fifth largest, having jumped four spots in the rankings during Prime Minister Narendra Modis decade in office. Indias economy grew by more than 8 in the fiscal year that ended in March, according to data published Friday. But India could do much more to raise its gross domestic product GDP per person, a measure of living standards according to which it ranked a lowly 147 in 2022. Building modern India India is spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. It added nearly 55,000 kilometers around 35,000 miles to its highway network, an increase of 60 in the overall length, between 2014 and 2023. And in recent years, the country has also built a range of tech infrastructure platforms. Stock market superpower The excitement around Indias growth potential is reflected in its stock market, which has been hitting record highs. The National Stock Exchange of India has overtaken both the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Exchange to become the worlds sixth-largest bourse. Humming factories As international firms look to diversify their operations away from China, India has launched a program worth 26 billion to attract companies to set up manufacturing in 14 sectors. Where are the jobs? If re-elected, Modi has to tackle the enormous challenge of creating hundreds of millions of jobs for a population that remains largely impoverished. With an average age of 29 years, India has one of the youngest populations globally, but the country is not yet able to reap the potential economic benefits from its large, youthful population. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will need a coalition partner to form a government, but this may be challenging since Modi has centralized power both in the country  and in his own party, Neelanjan Sircar, a senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research told CNN from Singapore. Sircar noted that many red lines were crossed by Modi, using state institutions against opposition leaders and the media. He said that voters on the ground felt that certain lines have been crossed, even if they didnt say so explicitly. Born into poverty three years after Indias independence, Narendra Modi has ascended to the pinnacle of the nations political landscape. Modis father Damordas was a chaiwallah, or tea seller, at the familys local train station in the western state of Gujarat. Modi said he helped his father sell tea as the family struggled to make ends meet  which he said helped him understand the problems plaguing Indian society at the grassroots level. Modi entered Indian politics at just 8 years old when he enrolled in classes at the local branch of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a right-wing organization that advocates for the supremacy of Hinduism in India. He joined the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP as a young man and worked his way up the ranks, becoming chief minister of the wealthy state of Gujarat. He was first elected prime minister in 2014 with a roaring majority on a ticket of nationalism and development. While he is credited with implementing economic and social reforms, the BJPs majoritarian policies have polarized the nation, dividing it across religious lines. His reelection in 2019 signaled to many analysts that India was shifting away from its founding secular roots to a Hindu-first state, something that accelerated during Modis second term. This years election is a pivotal moment in the nations post-independence era, with the outcome capable of shaping the countrys trajectory with Modi at its helm. The Bharatiya Janata Partys BJP campaign manifesto centers on job creation and anti-poverty and development programs, with a particular focus on women, the poor, young people and farmers. Modi wants to turn India into a global manufacturing hub, continue its massive infrastructure transformation, and achieve energy independence by 2047. Worth 3.7 trillion in 2023, India is the worlds fifth-largest economy, having jumped four spots in the rankings during his decade in office. Modi has pledged that India will have the worlds third-largest economy during a possible third term. However, economic successes have been slow to trickle down to the countrys poorest and Indias gross domestic product GDP per person is ranked a lowly 147 in 2022, according to the World Bank. Modi wants India to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council, will push to bid for the 2036 Summer Olympics and aims to land an astronaut on the moon, and has pledged to transform the country into a developed nation by 2047. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis victory speech chimed with the image that he has projected throughout his decade in power confident and with no admission of any defeats. Despite facing shock upsets in the election, Modi did not admit this as he spoke. His Bharatiya Janata Party BJP is on track to fall short of an outright majority and is set to form a coalition government with his allied parties to remain in power. Still, Modi triumphantly declared that he would govern India for the next five years, promising an era of development and prosperity. And he strategically spotlighted the coalition he now needs to form a government. Preliminary figures from the Election Commission indicate the BJP is short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on longstanding allies to form a government. Modi is set to form a government with the help of the NDA  securing him a third consecutive term  a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India. Full results are expected in the coming hours, but current trends show they are nonetheless something of a personal blow to Modi, who had triumphantly vowed to win a 400-seat supermajority in this years election. Indias Prime Minister Narendra Modi has declared victory in the countrys mammoth general election, but the vote count is ongoing. As of 9.30 p.m. local time 12 p.m. ET, Modis Bharatiya Janata Party BJP has secured at least 190 seats according to the Election Commission of India  well below the 400 seat supermajority it was hoping for. Meanwhile, the National Congress Party has the second-largest majority, having so far won 73 seats. Two seats had shocking results, with the BJP winning a seat in Kerala for the first time. BJP candidate Suresh Gopi won the seat of Thrissur with 412,338 votes. It had previously been run by the Left Democratic Front since 2016. But the BJP also suffered a shock loss, conceding the seat of Faizabad where Modi inaugurated the controversial Ram Mandir temple in January. Awadhesh Prasad from the opposition Samajwadi Party won there instead, in a massive shock for the ruling government whose building of the grand Hindu temple was a key campaign tool. With early results indicating that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis Bharatiya Janata Party BJP may not win an outright majority, it will be reliant on its coalition partners to form a government. Those partners include dozens of right-wing parties from the National Democratic Alliance NDA, a BJP-led group that has been in power since his first election in 2014. Formed in 1998, the NDA was created as an antithesis to Indias main opposition, the Indian National Congress. It includes several regional parties, including the Hindu nationalist Shiv Sena, which governs the western state of Maharashtra, and the Janata Dal United, which has a presence in the countrys northeast. Generally the parties skew right-wing, but not all are as openly Hindu nationalist, with a variety of policies and platforms. Some are very focused on local areas where they draw support. The alliances chairmen included former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and co-founder of the BJP L. K. Advani. Indias Prime Minister Narendra Modi has declared victory in the countrys mammoth general election, as votes continue to get counted. Modi made the remarks in a speech at the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP headquarters in New Delhi. Supporters threw rose petals at the Indian leader as he made his way to the stage. Chants of Modi! Modi! Modi! reverberated through the crowd as Modi spoke. Early results suggest that Modis BJP may have to rely on coalition partners to form a government. Those partners include dozens of parties from the NDA, a BJP-led group that has been in power since his first election in 2014. Although final results are still outstanding, Modis alliance is on track to gain 272 seats, according to the Election Commissions website, the minimum number required to form a government. Full results are expected in the coming hours.",

The stock listed at 1,934 rupees 23 on Indias National Stock Exchange, below its offer price of 1,960 rupees 23.31, and traded down 4 at 1,882.10 rupees 22.39 by 0548 GMT 148 a.m. ET, giving the company a valuation of 1.53 trillion rupees 18.2 billion. Hyundai, Indias No. 2 carmaker with a market share of 15, was targeting a valuation of 19 billion through the IPO. Its record 3.3 billion IPO was oversubscribed more than two-fold last week, led largely by institutional investors, but pricing concerns deterred retail investors who worried they would not be able to make gains on the listing. Shares of Indian rivals have also slipped in recent weeks as car sales slow after two years of record highs, with customers delaying purchases on worries about stubborn inflation. Hyundais issue has been stiffly priced and that seems to be weighing down on its listing as well, said Arun Kejriwal, founder of Kejriwal Research. Besides, the volumes seen so far are driven only by institutional investors, and is rather poor for an IPO of Hyundais size.

Nomura started coverage of Hyundai with a buy rating and price target of 2,472 rupees 29.40.
